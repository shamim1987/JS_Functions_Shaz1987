Homework: Write some functions!

Long questions

1.Write a function lengths that accepts a single parameter as an argument, namely an array of strings. The function should return an array of numbers where each number is the length of the corresponding string.
var words = ["hello", "what", "is", "up", "dude"]
lengths(words)  # => [5, 4, 2, 2, 4]
2.Write a Javascript function called transmogrifier. This function should accept three arguments, which you can assume will be numbers. Your function should return the "transmogrified" result.
The transmogrified result of three numbers is the product of the first two numbers, raised to the power of the third number.
For example, the transmogrified result of 5, 3, and 2 is (5 times 3) to the power of 2 is 225. Use your function to find the following answers.
transmogrifier(5, 4, 3)
transmogrifier(13, 12, 5)
transmogrifier(42, 13, 7)
3.Write a function wordReverse that accepts a single argument, a string. The method should return a string with the order of the words reversed. Don't worry about punctuation.
wordReverse("Now I know what a TV dinner feels like")
# => "like feels dinner TV a what know I Now"
wordReverse("Put Hans back on the line")
# => "line the on back Hans Put"

Short questions

Follow the requirements in the list below:
1.Define a function maxOfTwoNumbers that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in JavaScript. Do some Googling to figure this out if you forget how conditionals work.
2.Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3.Write a function isCharacterAVowel that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel and false, otherwise.
4.Define a function sumArray and a function multiplyArray that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. For example, sumArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiplyArray([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
5.Write a function that returns the number of arguments passed to the function when called.
6.Define a function reverseString that reverses a string. For example, reverseString("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
7.Write a function findLongestWord that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest word in the array.
8.Write a function filterLongWords that takes an array of words and a number x and returns a new array of words that are longer than x characters long.

Submission

Submit everything in one JavaScript file functions.js. Rename all your .functions like so: long1, long2, short1 etc
Bonus questions

Attach the function reverseString (from question 6) to the object String so that it is possible to call: "General Assembly".reverseString().
Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns an object where:
the keys are the characters that occur in the string
the values are the number of occurrences for each letter, regardless of the case
For example, calling the function with the string "General Assembly" will return:
{
 a: 2,
 b: 1,
 e: 3,
 g: 1,
 l: 2,
 m: 1,
 n: 1,
 r: 1,
 s: 2,
 y: 1
}
